# Portfolio-App
This is the module 2 challenge for bootcamp.  It will act a single page portfolio to show off my work

## Desription

-As a user I want the website to give me an idea of who Taylor is and what work he has completed, to inform me of his skills. I also want a way to contact him and look further into his code.

-This was a project that was built from the ground up. No starter code utilized!

-Basic proof of concept or "MVP" for a portfolio website: With Title, Navbar, About section, Selected work section, and a contact section. 

-This was a great project to dive deeper into flex-box and media queries to make the website responsive to diffrent screen sizes.
